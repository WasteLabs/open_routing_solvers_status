# Status of open source routing solvers

A repo to discuss, analyse and explore the status of open-source routing solvers.

It draws heavey insperation from the article (Open Source Routing Engines And Algorithms â€“ An Overview)[https://gis-ops.com/open-source-routing-engines-and-algorithms-an-overview/]. The idea is to product something similar for routing solvers.
