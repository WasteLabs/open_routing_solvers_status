# Status of openource routing optimisation solvers

A repo to discuss, analyse and explore the status of open-source routing solvers for practical applications.

It draws heavy insperation from the article [Open Source Routing Engines And Algorithms â€“ An Overview](https://gis-ops.com/open-source-routing-engines-and-algorithms-an-overview/). The idea is to produce something similar for routing solvers.
